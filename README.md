## Disclaimers

- The frontend UI is designed to contextualize the CarparkAPI and provide a (hopefully) interesting experience when testing out the backend APIs.
  
- The **'GET /car/lots'** API is not part of the 3 defined API requirements and is only meant for contextualization purposes. It is not intended for grading.
